Submit your work as a zip or tar archive, or as a shared git repository. 
It should be self-contained and you should include a README file with 
instructions on how to run the code. This exercise should not take more than xx 
minutes to complete, however we allocate xx hours and ask that you submit what 
you have completed at the xx-hour mark. This is your chance to show us at your

meets the specs, and works with the provided UI.
